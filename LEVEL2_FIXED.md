# ✅ Level 2 FIXED! Now Works Like Cell Collective!

## 🎉 What Changed

I completely rebuilt Level 2 to work **exactly like Cell Collective:**

### Now You Can:
1. ✅ **Add components** from the palette
2. ✅ **Drag components** anywhere on the canvas to position them
3. ✅ **Click and drag** from one component to another to draw an arrow
4. ✅ **See a preview** (dashed orange line) while drawing
5. ✅ **Release on target** component to complete the arrow
6. ✅ **Click arrows** to delete them
7. ✅ **Right-click components** to remove them

## 🎓 What Students Learn

Level 2 teaches:
1. **Spatial organization** - Components can be arranged logically
2. **Directional relationships** - A → B means A affects B
3. **Pathway building** - Creating chains and branches
4. **Visual thinking** - Understanding systems through diagrams
5. **Cell Collective interface** - Exact same workflow!
