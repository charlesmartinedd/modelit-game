# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: New Server URL!

## The Fresh Server is Now Running On:

## **http://localhost:3003**

(NOT 3002 anymore!)

---

## Why the Change?

Port 3002 was still occupied by the old server. I've restarted with a clean dev server that has ALL your changes:

‚úÖ All 10 levels with correct data
‚úÖ Home button (üè†) on every level
‚úÖ Fresh cache (no old code)

---

## Test Now!

1. **Close any tabs open to localhost:3002**
2. **Open a new tab to:** http://localhost:3003
3. **You should see:**
   - Landing page with all 10 levels
   - "‚ú® Testing Mode: Click any level to play directly!"
   - Click any level card to test it

4. **When in a level, you should see:**
   - üè† Home button in top-left corner (next to Level badge)
   - Clicking it returns you to the landing page
   - Different content for each level

---

## What to Test:

### Test 1: Home Button
1. Go to http://localhost:3003
2. Click "Level 1: Adding Components"
3. **Look for üè† button** in top-left of header
4. Click it - should return to landing page

### Test 2: Different Levels
1. Go to http://localhost:3003
2. Click "Level 2: Adding Arrows"
3. Header should say "Level 2" and "Adding Arrows"
4. Click üè† to go back
5. Click "Level 3: Relationship Types"
6. Header should say "Level 3" and "Relationship Types"
