## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Can add components
- [ ] Can click component to start arrow
- [ ] Component shows orange glow when selected
- [ ] Can click second component to complete arrow
- [ ] Arrow appears as blue line with arrowhead
- [ ] Can draw multiple arrows
- [ ] Can click arrow to delete it
- [ ] Can right-click component to remove it (deletes connected arrows too)

### Goal Matching:
- [ ] Goal panel shows required arrows
- [ ] Game auto-completes when all components AND arrows match
- [ ] Success modal appears
- [ ] Points awarded
- [ ] Next iteration loads

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Can't draw arrow to same component
- [ ] Clicking empty space cancels drawing
- [ ] Removing component removes its arrows
- [ ] Timer still works (30 seconds)
- [ ] Home button works

## 🎓 Educational Value

Level 2 teaches the fundamental Cell Collective skill of **creating relationships**:

1. **Understanding connections:** Some components affect others
2. **Directional relationships:** A → B means A influences B
3. **Building pathways:** Linear chains (A → B → C)
4. **Branching patterns:** Multiple inputs/outputs
5. **Cycles:** Feedback loops (A → B → C → A)

**This mirrors Cell Collective's arrow-drawing interface!**

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Level 3-10 still not built** - Only Levels 1 and 2 work
2. **Arrow labels not shown** - Just visual arrows (labels in future)
3. **No +/- types yet** - That's Level 3's feature
4. **Simple matching** - Doesn't check arrow directionality perfectly

---

## 🚀 What Works Now

**Playable Levels:**
- ✅ Level 1: Adding Components (5 iterations)
- ✅ Level 2: Adding Arrows (5 iterations)
- ❌ Levels 3-10: Data exists but no UI

**Total Playable:** 10 iterations across 2 levels

## 💡 Next Steps

Want me to build Level 3 (Relationship Types with +/-)?

Or would you prefer to:
1. Test Level 2 thoroughly first
2. Adjust difficulty/timing
3. Refine arrow drawing mechanics
4. Move on to Level 3

## 🎮 Quick Test Command

```bash
# Server is already running on port 3003
# Just open: http://localhost:3003

# Click "Level 2: Adding Arrows"
# Try Iteration 1:
# 1. Add Sun
# 2. Add Plant
# 3. Click Sun
# 4. Click Plant
# 5. Arrow should appear!
# 6. Game should complete automatically!
```
