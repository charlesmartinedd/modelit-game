# Model It! - Level 1: Adding Components

A Nintendo-quality educational game teaching students the fundamentals of computational modeling using Cell Collective.

## 🎮 Game Design

**Story**: Welcome to the Discovery Lab! Learn to build biological models by mastering the 10 fundamentals of systems thinking.

**Level 1 Focus**: Adding Components (Nodes) - The first skill in Cell Collective modeling

### Features
- ✨ 15 carefully designed iterations across 5 difficulty brackets
- 🎯 Auto-detection scoring system
- ⏱️ 30-second time challenges
- ⭐ Points & streak system
- 🎨 Beautiful, kid-friendly UI with smooth animations
- 📱 Touch-optimized for tablets
- 🧬 Real biology concepts (photosynthesis, cells, immune system, etc.)

### Difficulty Progression
1. **Bracket 1 (Easy)**: 2 components - Basic introduction
2. **Bracket 2 (Medium-Easy)**: 3 components - Building confidence
3. **Bracket 3 (Medium)**: 4 components - Core challenge
4. **Bracket 4 (Medium-Hard)**: 5 components - Advanced thinking
5. **Bracket 5 (Hard)**: 6+ components - Systems mastery

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The game will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Goal Panel (Left)**: Shows the components you need to add
2. **Workspace (Right Top)**: Where you build your model
3. **Component Palette (Right Bottom)**: Tap icons to add them
4. **Timer**: Complete each challenge in 30 seconds
5. **Success**: Auto-advances when you match all components

### Controls
- **Tap** component in palette → Adds to workspace
- **Tap** component in workspace → Removes it
- Complete the goal before time runs out!

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by Nintendo, Sega, and Capcom:
- **Instant feedback** - Every action has satisfying animation
- **Clear goals** - Always know what to do next
- **Progressive difficulty** - Gentle learning curve
- **Reward system** - Points and streaks for motivation
- **Polish** - Smooth animations, great sound (coming soon)

## 📚 Educational Alignment

Teaches students to use Cell Collective by:
- Understanding components as nodes in a biological network
- Recognizing biological entities (genes, proteins, cells)
- Building models piece by piece
- Preparing for Level 2: Adding Relationships (arrows)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Framer Motion** - Buttery smooth animations
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast dev server
- **Modern CSS** - Gradients, shadows, responsive design

## 📝 Next Steps

After mastering Level 1, students will progress to:
- **Level 2**: Adding Relationships (Arrows)
- **Level 3**: Relationship Types (Activation/Inhibition)
- **Level 4**: Component Properties
- ... and 6 more levels!

## 🎓 For Educators

This game teaches the EXACT interface students will use in Cell Collective, but gamified for engagement. After completing Level 1, students will be comfortable adding components to models in the full platform.
