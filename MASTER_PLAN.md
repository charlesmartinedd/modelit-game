- "Learn to build biological models just like scientists do"
- Button: "Let's Go!"

Step 2: Interface Tour
- Highlight Goal Panel: "This shows what you need to build"
- Highlight Workspace: "This is where you build your model"
- Highlight Palette: "Tap these icons to add components"
- Highlight Timer: "Complete each challenge in 30 seconds!"

Step 3: Practice Round
- Guided iteration: "Tap the Sugar icon 🍭"
- Auto-adds to workspace
- "Great! Now tap Energy ⚡"
- "Perfect! You matched the goal!"
- Success animation

Step 4: Ready to Play
- "You're ready! Starting Level 1..."
- Fade to actual game
```

#### Level 3: Relationship Types 🔀
**Teaches:** Activation (+) vs Inhibition (-)
**New mechanic:** Choose arrow type before connecting

1. Insulin (+)→ Glucose Uptake (activation)
2. Glucagon (-)→ Glycogen (inhibition)
3. Virus (-)→ Cell Health, Antibody (+)→ Cell Health
4. Stress (-)→ Sleep (+)→ Recovery
5. Gene ON (+)→ Protein, Gene OFF (-)→ Protein

#### Level 4: Component Properties ⚙️
**Teaches:** Setting initial states (ON/OFF, values)
**New mechanic:** Click component to set properties
**Iterations:**
1. Set Gene: ON, Protein: OFF
2. Set Temperature: HIGH, Enzyme Activity: HIGH
3. Set Glucose: 100, Insulin: LOW
4. Set Oxygen: HIGH, ATP Production: HIGH
5. Set Light: ON, Chlorophyll: ACTIVE, Glucose: PRODUCING

#### Level 5: Conditional Logic 🧠
**Teaches:** "IF condition THEN action" rules
**New mechanic:** Add conditional statements to arrows
**Iterations:**
1. IF Glucose > 100 THEN Insulin ON
2. IF Temperature < 37 THEN Shivering ON
3. IF Virus Present THEN Immune Response
4. IF Sunlight THEN Photosynthesis
5. IF ATP Low THEN Cell Respiration

#### Level 6: Running Simulations ▶️
**Teaches:** Execute model and observe behavior
**New mechanic:** "Play" button to run simulation
**Iterations:**
1. Build model, run, verify Energy increases
2. Build feedback loop, verify oscillation
3. Build cascade, verify sequential activation
4. Build negative feedback, verify stabilization
5. Build complex network, verify emergent behavior

#### Level 7: Reading Data 📊
**Teaches:** Interpret graphs and simulation outputs
**New mechanic:** Model already built, read the graph
**Iterations:**
1. Identify which component increased over time
2. Identify which component decreased
3. Find the oscillating component
4. Determine when equilibrium was reached
5. Identify feedback loop from data pattern

#### Level 8: Debugging Models 🐛
**Teaches:** Fix broken models to match expected output
**New mechanic:** Model has errors, student fixes them
**Iterations:**
1. Wrong arrow direction (A→B should be B→A)
2. Missing component needed for output
3. Wrong relationship type (+/-)
4. Incorrect initial state
5. Multiple errors (2-3 fixes needed)

#### Level 9: Multi-Scale Systems 🌐
**Teaches:** Connect subsystems (molecular → cellular → organism)
**New mechanic:** Multiple workspaces/layers
**Iterations:**
1. Gene → Protein → Cell Function
2. Nutrient → Metabolism → Organism Growth
3. Virus → Immune Cell → Body Health
4. Photosynthesis → Plant Growth → Ecosystem
5. Neuron → Brain → Behavior

#### Level 10: Complete Modeling 🏆
**Teaches:** Build models from scratch (no goal shown)
**New mechanic:** Open-ended challenges
**Iterations:**
1. "Model how glucose provides energy"
2. "Model how plants make oxygen"
3. "Model how the immune system fights viruses"
4. "Model cell division"
5. "Model ecosystem food web"

## Next Steps

Since this is a LOT of code, I recommend:

**Option A:** I can continue building incrementally (will take many messages)

**Option B:** I can create a GitHub-ready package with all files and you can clone/install it

**Option C:** I can focus on finishing Tutorial + Levels 1-3 perfectly first, then tackle 4-10

Which approach works best for you?
