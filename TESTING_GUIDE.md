## 🐛 Known Issues to Test

### Level 2-10 Components
**Note:** Currently only Level 1 has a working UI component. Levels 2-10 will need:
- Custom UI for arrow drawing (Level 2)
- Arrow type selectors +/- (Level 3)
- State toggle buttons (Level 4)
- Rule builder interface (Level 5)
- Simulation playback (Level 6)
- Graph display (Level 7)
- Debugging interface (Level 8)
- Multi-scale workspace (Level 9)
- Combined interface (Level 10)

**Testing strategy for now:**
1. Test Level 1 completely (fully functional)
2. For Levels 2-10, verify:
   - Data files load correctly
   - Level can be selected
   - GameEngine receives correct data
   - No console errors
