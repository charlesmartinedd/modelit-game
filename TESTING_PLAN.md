## 🐛 Known Issues to Check

1. **Level 2 Arrow Matching** - Fuzzy matching implemented, validate it works
2. **Chart.js Integration** - First use in Level 7, check for console errors
3. **State Management** - Complex state across Levels 4-10, check for bugs
4. **Cross-scale Arrows** - Level 9 feature, validate rendering
5. **Simulation Logic** - Level 6 propagation algorithm, verify accuracy
